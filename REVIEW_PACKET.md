## Phase-by-Phase Summary

### Phase 1 — Verified Balbharti Ingestion ✅

**Goal:** Replace synthetic curriculum seed dependency with verified ingestion capability.

**Status:** COMPLETE. 4 verified Balbharti textbooks registered:
- `BALBHARTI_MATH_G1_MM` — Grade 1 Mathematics, Marathi Medium
- `BALBHARTI_MATH_G2_MM` — Grade 2 Mathematics, Marathi Medium
- `BALBHARTI_ENGLISH_G1_MM` — Grade 1 English, Marathi Medium
- `BALBHARTI_SCIENCE_G3_MM` — Grade 3 Science, Marathi Medium

All sources verified as `AUTHENTIC` against the Maharashtra State Board of Education (Balbharti). Lineage tracking enabled. OCR pipeline interface configured with 0.95 accuracy threshold.

**Validation checks (all passed):**
- All textbooks carry `verification_status: VERIFIED`
- Ingestion proof confirms `all_verified: true`
- Lineage tracking is `enabled`

---

### Phase 2 — Curriculum Intelligence Extraction ✅

**Goal:** Convert textbooks into structured educational knowledge.

**Status:** COMPLETE. Extraction manifests present and populated:

- `chapter_manifest.json` — Chapter-level curriculum structure
- `concept_manifest.json` — Concept definitions with learning outcomes
- `exercise_manifest.json` — Exercises and questions with answers
- `glossary_manifest.json` — Terminology and definitions
- `curriculum_lineage_registry.json` — Full lineage chain: Textbook → Chapter → Section → Concept → Exercise

**Lineage model:** Every extracted element traces back to its source textbook edition.

---

### Phase 3 — Pedagogical Learning Graph ✅

**Goal:** Transform the structural graph into a pedagogical dependency graph.

**Status:** COMPLETE. The `pedagogical_graph.json` implements a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with:

**Arithmetic Progression:**
```
Number Recognition → Counting → Number Sequence → Place Value
                   ↘                 ↘
                    Addition Basic → Subtraction Basic
                         ↘
                          Multiplication Intro → Fractions Intro
```

**Graph Statistics:**
- 8 concepts across Grades 1–3
- 9 edges (PREREQUISITE_FOR, FOUNDATION_FOR, ENABLES)
- 2 learning progressions defined
- Validated: acyclic, no circular dependencies

---

### Phase 4 — Student Intelligence / Mastery Engine ✅

**Goal:** Upgrade recommendation engine to full mastery engine.

**Status:** COMPLETE. New file: `learning_runtime/mastery_engine.py`

**Implemented capabilities:**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Concept mastery tracking | `compute_concept_mastery()` — 60% accuracy + 40% EMA confidence |
| Confidence tracking | Exponential Moving Average (α=0.30) over attempt history |
| Weak-area detection | `detect_weak_areas()` — threshold-based with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority |
| Remediation routing | `generate_remediation_routing()` — prerequisite-graph aware |
| Progress estimation | `estimate_progress()` — learning velocity + ETA computation |
| Full engine cycle | `MasteryEngine` class with `record_exercise()` + `build_progress_state()` |

**Runtime output fields added to every response:**
```json
{
  "mastery_score": 0.7233,
  "concept_strengths": ["CONCEPT_NUMBER_RECOGNITION"],
  "concept_weaknesses": ["CONCEPT_PLACE_VALUE"],
  "recommended_remediation": [...],
  "learning_progress_state": {...}
}
```

---

### Phase 5 — Teacher Runtime ✅

**Goal:** Build teacher-facing intelligence layer.

**Status:** COMPLETE (pre-existing `teacher_runtime.py` verified and validated).

**Views implemented:**

| View | Method | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| Class View | `generate_class_view()` | Aggregate metrics, performance distribution |
| Student Progress View | `generate_student_progress_view()` | Per-student mastery sorted by score |
| Curriculum Completion View | `generate_curriculum_completion_view()` | Per-concept class-aggregate completion |
| Remediation View | `generate_remediation_view()` | CRITICAL→HIGH→MEDIUM→LOW priority sorted |

All views verified by tests. Remediation sort order validated.

---

### Phase 6 — Production Runtime Convergence ✅

**Goal:** Single canonical execution path for all student queries.

**Status:** COMPLETE. New file: `learning_runtime/canonical_runtime.py`

**Canonical Pipeline (7 stages, no parallel paths):**
```
StudentQuery
  → Stage 1: Retrieval (MasterDB)
  → Stage 2: Curriculum Intelligence (lineage extraction)
  → Stage 3: Learning Intelligence (gap + path)
  → Stage 4: Mastery Intelligence (mastery engine)
  → Stage 5: Constitutional Runtime (rule engine)
  → Stage 6: Runtime Contract (binding)
```

**Validated by test:** `test_no_parallel_execution_paths` confirms each stage appears exactly once in the trace. `convergence_validated: true` is present on every output contract.

## Production Expansion Sprint Control

**Date Generated:** 2026-06-25

The AI-normalized Balbharti expansion brief is now represented as an executable in-repo sprint control layer. This layer does not add synthetic curriculum and does not certify absent licensed textbooks.

| Deliverable | Location | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Assigned textbook manifest | `curriculum/production_expansion/assigned_textbooks_manifest.json` | Generated from current verified authority registry |
| Licensed textbook drop hierarchy | `masterdb/balbharti/licensed_textbooks/README.md` | Ready for confidential licensed assets |
| Production expansion gate report | `curriculum/production_expansion/production_expansion_report.json` | Current canonical snapshot certified; new expansion blocked pending assigned downloads |
| Vijay cross-validation report | `curriculum/production_expansion/vijay_cross_validation_report.json` | Blocked pending declared Vijay assignments |
| Sprint validator | `scripts/production_expansion_sprint.py` | Executable |

**Current production result:** `CERTIFIED_CURRENT_CANONICAL_SNAPSHOT`

**Current expansion result:** `BLOCKED_PENDING_ASSIGNED_LICENSED_TEXTBOOK_DOWNLOADS`

**Reason:** No newly assigned licensed textbook binaries, Samachar extraction output, or Vijay-owned assignment set is present in this checkout. The production gate intentionally blocks any new curriculum merge until textbook evidence and independent cross-validation are available.
