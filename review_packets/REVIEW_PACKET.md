# REVIEW_PACKET.md - UniGuru BHIV Ecosystem Integration

Generated at: `2026-07-03T12:27:38.121834Z`
Status: `ACCEPTED`

## Scope
UniGuru participates in the BHIV execution chain as an internal intelligence capability while exposing only governed, redacted capability output to Mitra.

## Live Evidence
- Vijay integration proof: `review_packets/integration_proof/ecosystem_execution_latest.json` -> `vijay_validation`
- TANTRA integration proof: `review_packets/integration_proof/ecosystem_execution_latest.json` -> `tantra_contract`
- Bucket telemetry evidence: `review_packets/integration_proof/bucket_ecosystem_acceptance_live.json`
- InsightFlow evidence: `review_packets/integration_proof/ecosystem_execution_latest.json` -> `insightflow_observability`
- GC validation evidence: `review_packets/integration_proof/ecosystem_execution_latest.json` -> `gc_validation`
- MDU validation evidence: `review_packets/integration_proof/ecosystem_execution_latest.json` -> `mdu_validation`
- Cross-service replay logs: `review_packets/integration_proof/replay_verification_latest.json`
- API response logs: `review_packets/logs/ecosystem_acceptance_api_responses.json`
- Deployment validation: `review_packets/deployment_proof/ecosystem_deployment_validation.json`

## Runtime Flow
`Mitra/BHIV request -> /runtime/ecosystem/execute -> deterministic Kosha pipeline -> Vijay replay validation -> TANTRA contract -> Bucket telemetry -> InsightFlow observability -> GC authority validation -> MDU schema/provenance validation -> governed response`

## Integration Points
- Internal BHIV: `POST /runtime/ecosystem/execute` returns full integration evidence.
- Replay validation: `POST /runtime/ecosystem/replay` verifies stable runtime, contract, authority and lineage fields.
- Mitra-facing: `POST /mitra/ecosystem/ask` returns answer, verification state, replay status, contract schema and evidence pointers without internal governance payloads.
- Health: `GET /health`, readiness: `GET /ready`, metrics: `GET /metrics`.

## Known Limits
- This workspace run validates local production parity through FastAPI request handling; external BHIV service deployment still needs environment-specific endpoint URLs and credentials.
- Bucket evidence is file-backed unless `UNIGURU_BUCKET_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` is configured in deployment.
- Screenshot folders contain evidence notes for API/runtime artifacts; no UI dashboard capture was required for this backend-only convergence run.
